'The Influence of Greenwashing and Misleading Labels on Consumer Behaviour in the FMCG Industry'. 
This research is conducted by Deepanshi, MSc Management student at Warwick Business School, as part of their dissertation.

This survey is split into 6 different sections and takes about 4 minutes to complete. Please understand that participating in this survey is entirely voluntary and you can withdraw at any point during the survey without having to provide any reason for your withdrawal. 

For any questions, please contact: deepanshi@warwick.ac.uk",What is your age?,What is your gender?,What is your highest level of education? - Selected Choice,What is your highest level of education? - Other (Please specify): _ - Text,What is your household average monthy income,"How often do you purchase Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) such as food, beverages, household items, or personal care products?","How familiar are you with environmental or green claims on FMCG products (e.g., eco-friendly, natural, sustainable)?",I understand the information presented on FMCG product labels and am satisfied with the clarity of these claims.,"How often do you read FMCG product labels to check for environmental claims (e.g., recyclable, sustainable, biodegradable)?",How clear and visible do you find environmental claims on FMCG product packaging?,What specific environmental claims do you usually look for on FMCG product labels? (Select all that apply) - Selected Choice,What specific environmental claims do you usually look for on FMCG product labels? (Select all that apply) - Other (Please specify): - Text,Have you ever seen an FMCG product that made environmental claims on its label that you found to be exaggerated or false?,How confident are you in identifying misleading or false environmental claims on FMCG product labels?,What specific elements make you suspect that an FMCG product’s label or advertisement is misleading regarding environmental claims? (Select all that apply) - Selected Choice,What specific elements make you suspect that an FMCG product’s label or advertisement is misleading regarding environmental claims? (Select all that apply) - Other (Please specify): - Text,How much does the presence of environmental claims on FMCG products influence your purchasing decisions?,"If you find that a brand’s environmental claims are misleading, how likely are you to stop purchasing their products?",To what extent do misleading environmental claims affect your trust in a brand?,How much responsibility do you feel consumers have to verify the environmental claims made by FMCG brands?,Do you think FMCG brands intentionally use vague or misleading labels to make their products seem more environmentally friendly?,"Greenwashing in the FMCG Industry happens when companies make their products seem more environmentally friendly than they really are. This is done by using words like ""natural,"" ""eco-friendly,"" or ""green"" without providing clear proof or proper details. In the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, greenwashing is a way to attract customers who care about the environment, even though the product may not truly help the environment as claimed. It misleads consumers into thinking a product is better for the planet than it actually is.

In your opinion, how common is greenwashing in the FMCG industry?","How often do you read the ingredients list on FMCG product labels to verify the accuracy of environmental claims (e.g., ""natural,"" ""chemical-free"")?","Do you feel that FMCG brands provide sufficient transparency about the sourcing and processing of ingredients, particularly in products claiming to be ""green"" or ""eco-friendly""?","To what extent do you agree that some FMCG products claim to have ""natural"" or ""green"" ingredients but still contain harmful or synthetic chemicals?",Do you think FMCG brands use complex or scientific terminology in the ingredients list to obscure the presence of potentially harmful chemicals or additives?,Would you prefer if FMCG brands provided more detailed information about their ingredients and the environmental impact of their products?,"How often do you buy instant or fast-cooking FMCG food products (e.g., instant noodles, ready-to-eat meals)?",Do you prefer fast-cooking meals over traditional cooking due to convenience?,"Are you aware that consuming instant or fast-cooking meals may have potential health risks despite being marketed as ""natural"" or ""healthy""?","If you are aware of the potential health risks of instant cooking items, do you still choose them due to convenience?",How likely are you to continue purchasing instant cooking products even if their environmental claims are misleading or unclear?,To what extent does price influence your decision to purchase an FMCG product that makes environmental claims?,"If an FMCG product contains misleading environmental claims but is priced significantly lower than a truly eco-friendly product, which would you choose?",Do you believe that misleading environmental claims should be more strictly regulated by the government?,"Would you be willing to pay more for an FMCG product with verified and transparent environmental claims, even if the price is higher than misleading products?"
